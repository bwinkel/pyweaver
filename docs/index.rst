Documentation
=============

This is the documentation for pyweaver.
In radio astronomy (single-dish) mapping offen suffers from scanning artefacts,
which can be caused from atmospheric variations for example. If two orthogonal
scan directions were recorded, the basket-weaving technique can help to remove
these artefacts.
